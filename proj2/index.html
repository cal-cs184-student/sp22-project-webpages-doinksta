		<h1>Part 1</h1>
		<em>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</em>
		<br><br>
		<p>De Casteljau’s algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to compute points along the Bezier curve. The algorithm takes in as input an ordered list of n control points and a real value t between 0 and 1. On the first pass of de Casteljau’s algorithm, we compute n - 1 linear interpolations between consecutive pairs of points that were initially given to us, using a weight of (1 - t) for the first point and a weight of t for the second point; this creates the second iteration of ordered points of length n - 1. We then repeat this process recursively to get the next iteration of points, all the way until we only have one point. This is the point on the Bezier curve that corresponds with the value of t imputed; as t varies between 0 and 1, this draws out the entirety of the Bezier curve defined by the control points.</p>

		<em>Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.</em>

		<p>Done!</p>

		<h1>Part 2</h1>
		<em>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</em>
		<br><br>
		<p>To use de Casteljau for Bezier surfaces, we first need to take in as input a grid of n x n control points and two parameters u and v that both range between 0 and 1, instead of simply an ordered list of n control points and one parameter t that varies between 0 and 1 (which was for the 2D case). Then, for each row inside our grid of control points, we can recursively apply de Casteljau’s algorithm with parameter u until we end up with a single point for each row. Afterwards, using these n remaining points, we can once again apply de Casteljau’s algorithm with parameter v to receive our final point, which becomes a point on the Bezier surface.</p>

		<h1>Part 3</h1>
		<em>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</em>
		<br><br>
		<p>First, we implemented a while loop that traverses through all the edges incident from the vertex. We know that different edges will point towards different faces, so if we grab the face associated with each edge incident from the vertex, that will give us all the faces incident from the vertex. For each face, we computed the cross product of two of its edges and divided by 2; this resulted in a normal vector with magnitude equal to the area of the triangular face. Finally, we added these weighted normals up from each face and then normalized the final vector to get the area-weighted vertex normal.</p>
