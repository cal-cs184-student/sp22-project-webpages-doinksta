		When we change the density of the point masses, we find that the least dense has the least amount of sagging of the cloth from the pinned corners, while the more dense has larger sagging due to the force of gravity being larger when the masses of each point increase. The larger point masses also seem to correspond with more folding of the cloth, probably due to the increase of mass of each of the point masses makes the spring force larger.

		Low ks case looks like the high density case, lots of ripples folded in on itself.

		<em>
			Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
		</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		A shader program is a program written in GLSL that is placed on the GPU to accelerate graphics rendering. The two types of shader programs used in this assignment are vertex and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders assign properties to individual vertices, such as color, normal vector direction, tangent vector direction, etc. The output of the vertex shader is then sent to the fragment shader, which handles interpolating the properties of individual vertices over points in between the original vertices (e.g. over triangular surfaces). The fragment shader then can be instructed on how to use these interpolated properties of points to determine the fragment’s final color; examples of this include interpolating colors of original vertices, or using the location associated with the fragment to sample from a texture or material map. The final fragment colors are then sent to the renderer to be drawn on the screen.

		<em>
			Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
		</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		The Blinn-Phong shading model attempts to create plausible lighting effects for objects of different material types. The model has three main components that are added together to determine the final luminance at each point on an object. 
		The Blinn-Phong shading model is a not physically based model of lighting, but rather categorizes lighting into three components, the ambient global lighting which is added to every point, the diffuse lighting which depends on the lighting direction, and the specular lighting for shiny parts of objects.

			Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.
		</em>

		<br>
		<br>

		The two approaches are the same up until you displace the position of the point on either the sphere or the cloth for the displacement method. Therefore, we see more 3D texture for the displacement method, and it renders the height map more realistically in conjunction with the bump method, which affects the texture by modifying the direction of the normal.

		The lower resolution mesh grid appears more blocky, and therefore, the displacement mapping change the geometry at only a couple of locations, so it was very granular. However, when we use 128, we find that there is alot of geometrical texture changes and is much smoother.
